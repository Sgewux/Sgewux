## My work
Here in my GitHub you can find some of the projects i've done and also the ones im still working on. In my pinned repositories you could find some projects like :
-	A Django app in a context of a forums page.
-	A FastAPI REST API in a context of a Library management system, and also the database schema made from scratch in PostgreSQL (not finished yet)
-	Client server model using socket programming in Python and Java. In a context of a multi-client CLI chat.
-	Some Machine learning algorithms like logistic and linear regression written by me from scratch.
-	REST API made with Spring Boot in a context of a drugstore management system (still not public repo)
